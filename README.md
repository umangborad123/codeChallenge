# Interview Coding Challenges #

Each JS file has comments explaining each challenge. You may use your choice of development tools, package manager (NPM or Bower), or 3rd-party libraries
to solve the challenges.

You are allowed to perform quick Google searches throughout the challenge. You may also comment and uncomment the `test#.js` files as you progress through the challenge if you desire. If you have any questions regarding the challenges, feel free to ask.

## Challenges ##
1. Identify the Missing Number
1. Locate the Error

### Identify the Missing Number ###
There are two arrays. One of the arrays is missing a number. Design a function that accepts the two arrays and determines which array is missing a value. Then identify what the missing value is. This tests your logic flow and basic JavaScript.

### Locate the Error ###
In this file somewhere, there is an error that is causing one of the functions to fail. While you may not completely understand the file, you are responsible to locate where the error occurs and if able, fix it. This is to test your logic flow and ability to debug code.
